# MarkdownDeep-Swift
Markdown to HTML converter using extended Markdown syntax. This is a port of MarkdownDeep for C#

## MarkdownDeep - CSharp

I have used MarkdownDeep on the Windows desktop for many years. It provides a fast and 
simple way to convert Markdown to HTML and includes several extended Markdown extensions. In particuar
there is a PHP markdown processor and MarkdownDeep supports it's extensions. So, my little
world is complete and I have all the markdown support I need.

### Enter the Mac

Then I had a hankering to write some code on the Mac. While there are many Markdown processors
for the Mac, I found nothing that supported the same extensive syntax as MarkdownDeep. Well, I needed to
get a better handle on the SWIFT language, so what better way than to convert the C# code to
SWIFT.

Hence this project.

## The Conversion

Importantly, at this stage, I have completed the conversion of the code. Better, I've completed the 
conversion of the test cases and added a few of my own. That gives me confidence that the overall
conversion has worked and that I can expect the same outputs from this code that I got from the C#
code. All those tests (there are over 200 of them) are a comfort.

## TODO

Converting the code is only the first step. When I integrated it into a Mac application, it worked well but
occasionally seemed to have a performance issue. I need to try and diagnose that and get it fixed. In the 
application I'm using it in, it will be called often so I cannot have it stop for a couple of seconds. 

I also need a better readme for this repo. 

You can find information on the C# variant on their site:
